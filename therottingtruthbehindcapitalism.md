## THE ROTTING TRUTH BEHIND CAPITALISM

### A Manifesto by Antonio Morton


## Part #1: The Illusion of Progress

Imagine a giant Sequoia tree. It’s been around for hundreds of years; it looks amazing on the
outside, but internally? It’s full of rot and termites. The truth is that with one strong enough storm, it all
falls apart. This tree represents capitalism. It looks amazing from the outside, but it’s not doing so well
when you really look into it. Many don’t question the system, and those who do, most of them think the
system isn’t working. Truth be told, the system is working perfectly as intended. Capitalism wasn’t
created around the worker, but the 1% who benefit from the working class. It’s working; it’s just failing
us.
The system is currently eating itself alive; I see us in 30 years without capitalism, but rather
corporate feudalism. If you’re wondering what corporate feudalism is, that makes sense; you’re taught
capitalism is just going to work forever, but not only is that not true, I can guarantee that we’re ending
up here. We’re already seeing signs. Let me step back and explain corporate feudalism. Corporate
feudalism is where we don’t have a working class; people are in constant debt, not even the 1%, but the
0.0001% will be living in luxury; they’ll be living in bunkers and islands, living off us, working everything
off. You don’t own a house; no one can afford houses besides the extreme elite. Water, food, and
healthcare are treated as commodities, not rights. I’ll go in depth later, but all you need to understand
right now is we’re seeing it already; the working class today can’t afford housing. People say housing
prices will go down, but they won’t. Wages will stagnate; in fact, they are stagnant. All while the cost of
living continues to go up, leaving us not able to pay our bills.


## Part #2: The Evolution of Capitalism

Modern capitalism first started in the 1800s, but its roots go back to the 1600s. During the
industrial revolution. Life wasn’t the best, but there was a lot of innovation and industrial growth.
Which is amazing, but that isn’t showing the full picture; it was at the cost of brutal exploitation. The
system was raw and unfiltered, with no safety nets and no government interference, which led to
issues like monopolies.

Then the 2 World Wars happened, which also led to a lot, and I mean a lot of innovation. Socialist
movements such as the New Deal and unions pressured the US to implement some safety nets. The
core issue, such as inequality, still existed, and they were (and still are) major issues.

Then during the 1980s, Ronald Reagan became the 40th president of The United States of
America; he did a lot of bad stuff. Let’s start with tax cuts for the rich, so the working class pays more
and the rich don’t worry as much about taxes. He also started getting rid of labor unions, specifically
the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), and started airstrikes upon them. Then,
he went and slashed funding for a lot of public services, including schooling, social programs, and
healthcare.

All of this accelerated late-stage capitalism, and today, ignoring what conservatives tell you,
it’s almost impossible to make a living wage, let alone become a homeowner; soon other necessities
like food and water will become privatized and later, possibly out of reach for most Americans, leaving
them in debt for their entire lives.


## Part #3: What is Corporate Feudalism?

I’ve already gone into a bit about it, but I am going to tell you a bit more, because corporate
feudalism is a scary concept, and we’re heading straight for it if we don’t do anything. Let’s start with
how it happens: it happens because wages stagnate at a certain point; for instance, the federal
minimum wage hasn’t changed since July 2009, but at the same time, inflation is still happening.

This means people can’t afford things anymore, and we’ve seen this during the pandemic;
people were suffering not being able to pay for things. This will continue to happen until there is no
middle class; there will only be poverty and the rich. This will look a lot like feudalism, where there
also wasn’t a middle class, just serfs and lords. Serfs worked as slaves because not working means
they lost their lives, and lords lived off the fruits of the serf’s labor. The same thing will happen; we will
just be the serfs, and billionaires will become the lords.

More than that, it would be worse because of how capitalism works; it’s ruining the
environment too, so we will be suffering with constant natural disasters too. Billionaires (or lords, if
you would), it won’t matter because they’re living in bunkers, private islands, or even possibly space.
Have you ever wondered why Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are so interested in going to space?

Government intervention would be extremely minimal if it’s even there. All this government
will do is help enforce the corporations’ power. It would do this by being oppressive and pushing a lot of
propaganda.

## Part #4: Capitalist Propaganda System

For a system to work, everyone, or at least the majority, needs to agree on it. If people saw how
capitalism actually works, no one would like it, and there would be a revolution. This is bad for those
billionaires, corporations, and governments, because they thrive on capitalism.

The solution? Propaganda. Schools teach you that propaganda isn’t a thing anymore in the US.
This is a lie. The school system itself is teaching you to be obedient and not question the system; you
can see this in history class, as you learn a sanitized, US perspective of what happened, not what
actually happened.

I bet you’re also wondering about some other forms of United States propaganda, so I’ll start
with a concept that has been a thing for decades: The “American Dream” It’s an absolute scam. The idea
of working hard and then retiring at the end of your life is becoming less and less true. Most people are
working until the day they die. We’re spoon-fed this to make us think we will “make it”; we’re just being
exploited for our entire lives.

Another piece is what the US claims as “freedom”. Truth be told, the freedom that exists in
capitalism is only there for billionaires. I’ll keep this short and sweet: basically, how are you free if you
don’t have the right to live? Living is a privilege in the US; you have to work to live, while billionaires are
living on private islands. How is that fair?

Lastly, there’s corporate media, which distracts and divides us. How are we supposed to fight
our exploiters if we’re too busy fighting each other?


## Part #5: But what’s the Alternative?

At a young age, we’re taught that capitalism is the only system that works. This is a lie; it
couldn’t be farther from the truth. First, capitalism doesn’t work. It functions completely as intended.
The issue with that is it’s a system built for exploitation.

Before we continue, I need to mention that this is extremely important to understand.
Socialism does NOT mean the government controls everything. It also doesn’t mean that the
government is oppressive and authoritarian. All socialism means is people control the resources
democratically instead of a very few corrupt billionaires. We also cannot criticize capitalism; we need
to build something better, something stronger, and something fair!

There are solutions; I believe in a nation with worker-owned businesses instead of
corporations. Would be a vast improvement because businesses would be transparent, not these
shady big guys that we have to assume are these amazing people; the thing is, they aren’t. Let’s take a
company like Disney really quick; on the outside, they’re a progressive, left-winged company. They
aren’t. They covered up their racist cartoons of the early to mid-20th century. They’ve bought all their
competitors; now if you want to watch something, it’s owned by the mouse. They underpay their
workers at their theme parks, and the list goes on. They’re extremely corrupt, and the fact we don’t just
allow that but incentivize it needs to be changed.

Another thing is human needs absolutely need to become rights; there needs to be publicly
owned housing, water, and energy. And all basic needs and universal healthcare need to be rights. We
also can’t have an oligarchy, which, under the democratic costume, is what the US is. What we need is a
democratic economy controlled by the workers.


## Part #6: How We Fight Back.

We cannot allow corporate feudalism to happen, and it’s approaching quickly. We
need to take action now, and you reading this, I have some requests to make to you. This
can’t work with me just writing this; I need as much help as I can have.

First, you must spread awareness. We have to spread the word on corporate
feudalism. Everyone must understand the issue and why we must stop it from happening.

For business owners and workers, we need to organize unions and worker co-ops!
This means workers get a say, not rich shareholders. We are putting our work into this;
why would this millionaire dictate what you do?

We must boycott and resist mega-corporations. If they can’t make money, they
would be forced into changing their corrupt tactics. We must build parallel systems, like
mutual aid and bartering.

We need to protest; we will push for real policies. The working class can’t suffer
like this; it’s time we advocate for higher wealth taxes, universal housing, and free higher
education.

Lastly, we need to prepare for direct action. If the mega-corporations start treating
us like serfs, we have to resist like revolutionaries!


## Part #7: The Choice We Must Make.

To put it simply, we are at a crossroads. We can go one of two ways: a dystopian
future where mega-corporations and billionaires control our every move, and we either
become modern serfs, or we could stop it from happening.

I said earlier there was something extremely important; what I’m about to tell you
is even more important. That is, we are not powerless. Capitalism wants us to believe we
are, but that’s exactly how it keeps its grip.

Just like how I was talking about capitalism being a rotted giant sequoia, and if
there was a storm coming, it would obliterate it, the storm is coming.
